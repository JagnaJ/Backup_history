/*Microsoft SQL Server allows three basic types of SQL Server backup: Full backup. Differential backup. Transaction log backup.*/

Types of backups
copy-only backup
A special-use backup that is independent of the regular sequence of SQL Server backups.

data backup
A backup of data in a complete database (a database backup), a partial database (a partial backup), 
or a set of data files or filegroups (a file backup).

database backup
A backup of a database. Full database backups represent the whole database at the time the backup finished.
Differential database backups contain only changes made to the database since its most recent full database backup.

differential backup
A data backup that is based on the latest full backup of a complete or partial database or a set of data 
files or filegroups (the differential base) and that contains only the data extents that have changed 
since the differential base.

A differential partial backup records only the data extents that have changed in the filegroups since the
 previous partial backup, known as the base for the differential.

full backup
A data backup that contains all the data in a specific database or set of filegroups or files, and also 
enough log to allow for recovering that data.

log backup
A backup of transaction logs that includes all log records that were not backed up in a previous log backup. 
(full recovery model)

file backup
A backup of one or more database files or filegroups.

partial backup
Contains data from only some of the filegroups in a database, including the data in the primary filegroup,
 every read/write filegroup, and any optionally-specified read-only files.
